## About

This project visualizes the flow of funds from donor advised funds across the U.S as a proof of concept.

## The Data

Data is [available on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/irs-990-filing-data-now-available-as-an-aws-public-data-set/).


## To Do

- Update/Exit cycle rather than innerHTML clear
- Figure out why on occasion some of the data points don't work - see Network for Training and Development??

## Credits
